            <p><strong class="profile-name">Craig Pelton</strong><br>
                Pelton is the Dean of Greendale Community College. He is a graduate of Appatomax 
                University and holds a Bachelors of Educations degree. Pelton has worked in 
                Scholastics for over 10 years although his résumé could be seen as a poor reflection 
                of this since all his previous places of employment have since shut down.

                Frankie is a consultant hired to help improve Greendale. She may look like the lady from 
                the IT department but thats just a coincidence that they look alike. Please stop asking. Unless 
                you need help with your time at Greendale, then please reach out to Ms. Dart.

                Once the spanish instructor, turned student, turned security gaurd, turned dictator, turned 
                amnesiac, turned student again. Ben has had a long and rather confusing history here at Greendale 
                but we do appreciate his teaching abilities.

                head of Greendale's air conditioner repair annex and the real power behind Greendale. When Dean 
                Pelton decides to confront Laybourne over the annex 
                purchasing an espresso machine, Laybourne shows him that the air conditioning annex is the 
                primary source of Greendale's funding. He thus holds complete power over the dean's office.
