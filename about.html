                In the 1970's, computer genius <strong>Russell Borchert</strong> created the 9 track cassette player. The 8 track cassette industry bribed him to 
                prevent it from being manufactured and Russell became a millionaire. In 1974 he used the money to found a technological institute, 
                the "Greendale Computery College". He then began a project to create a computer which could process human emotion. Russell used gold 
                for the circuitry believing it to be a better conductor for emotions. His overt physical displays of affection for the machine he 
                built created a scandal at the school.

                The land upon which Greendale Community College would eventually be built was originally the site of an animal rendering 
                plant. In 1974, inventor <strong>Russell Borchert</strong> purchased the grounds and founded a technological institute known as the 
                "Greendale Computery College". The school's first head administrator was <strong>Dean Pizzini</strong> who had to deal with a scandal the 
                following year that almost shut down the college. This involved Borchert and his unnatural love for his computer science 
                experiment. Borchert was believed to have died from a "computer virus" so Dean Pizzini sealed off Borchert's computer lab 
                in case an actual contagion was involved. The city purchased the campus in the aftermath turning it into a traditional 
                community college.
