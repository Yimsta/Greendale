            In the 1970's, computer genius <strong>Russell Borchert</strong> created the 9 track cassette player. 
            The 8 track cassette industry bribed him to prevent it from being manufactured and Russell 
            became a millionaire. In 1974 he used the money to found a technological institute, the 
            "Greendale Computery College". He then began a project to create a computer which could process 
            human emotion. Russell used gold for the circuitry believing it to be a better conductor for 
            emotions. His overt physical displays of affection for the machine he built created a scandal 
            at the school. To spare his institution any embarrassment he willingly let Greendale's first 
            Dean seal him and the entire computer lab off from the rest of the campus.</p>
